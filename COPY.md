### What is Energy Flexibility?

Energy flexibility is your ability to shift or shape when devices use electricity—like precooling, delaying EV charging, or dispatching a battery at peak times. Used well, it can reduce bills, earn incentives where available, and improve resilience.

---

### Routes to Value

**Cut Costs**
Avoid peak electricity prices and demand charges where applicable. Simple scheduling can reduce your energy bill.

**Potential New Revenue**
Some UK programs may reward flexible demand. Check eligibility and compatibility before committing.

**Operational Value**
Smoother operations, improved resilience, and potential for lower carbon emissions claims.

### How This Tool Helps

1. **Estimate Value**: Get an indicative range of potential savings and revenue based on your assets
2. **Check Compatibility**: See which flexibility services can be "stacked" (used together)
3. **Understand Requirements**: Plain-English explanations of technical terms and program requirements
4. **Find Your Path**: Use case cards for common assets (EV fleets, batteries, HVAC, manufacturing)

## Value Estimator Tab

### Estimator Disclaimer

**Important**: These are estimates based on your inputs and general assumptions, not advice. Actual outcomes depend on your tariff, operations, and eligibility for specific programs. Always verify with NESO and your DNO before making commercial decisions.

---

## Use Cases Tab

### Use Case: EV Fleet Charging

**How it helps**: Delay or ramp charging to avoid peak prices; align with cheaper periods or renewable availability.

**What it takes**: Charger control + basic schedules; optional dynamic price feed.

**Quick wins**: Night-time charging policies; fleet stagger to avoid simultaneous peaks; simple price thresholds.

**Watch-outs**: Driver needs (charge windows), duty cycles, depot power limits.

---

### Use Case: Battery Energy Storage

**How it helps**: Charge when prices are low, discharge at peaks; provide rapid grid services for additional revenue.

**What it takes**: Battery control system; half-hourly or faster metering; pre-qualification for some services.

**Quick wins**: Time-of-use arbitrage; peak shaving for demand charge reduction; Dynamic Containment (if qualified).

**Watch-outs**: Cycling limits, degradation, minimum capacity requirements, contract lock-in periods.

---

### Use Case: HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning)

**How it helps**: Precool/preheat during off-peak hours; reduce load during peak periods while maintaining comfort.

**What it takes**: Building management system (BMS) or smart thermostat; understanding of thermal mass and comfort constraints.

**Quick wins**: Setback schedules for nights/weekends; precooling before demand peaks; avoiding peak pricing windows.

**Watch-outs**: Occupant comfort, building thermal properties, weather variability, rebound peaks.

---

### Use Case: Industrial/Manufacturing Processes

**How it helps**: Shift non-critical loads (pumps, compressors, cold storage) to off-peak; reduce demand charges.

**What it takes**: Process flexibility analysis; control systems; sometimes buffer storage (thermal, material).

**Quick wins**: Schedule batch processes overnight; stagger motor starts; optimize compressed air timing.

**Watch-outs**: Production schedules, quality constraints, shift patterns, safety interlocks.

## FAQ & Glossary Tab

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Will this disrupt my operations?**
No. We prioritize your constraints first—comfort windows, production schedules, duty cycles. Flexibility programs are designed to work around your core needs.

**Do I need new hardware?**
Often no. Many businesses can start with simple scheduling and policy changes. Advanced control can be added later if beneficial.

**Is this allowed in my area?**
Flexibility options vary by location and network operator. This tool shows general pathways and compatibility; verify eligibility with NESO and your local DNO.

**How accurate is the Value Estimator?**
It provides indicative ranges using transparent, editable assumptions. Actual results depend on your specific tariff, operational patterns, and program participation. Treat it as a first-pass filter, not a guarantee.

**What's the difference between NESO and DNO services?**
NESO (National Energy System Operator) runs national-level services for grid balancing. DNOs (Distribution Network Operators) run local services for regional network management. Some assets can participate in both.

**What does "stacking" mean?**
Stacking means combining multiple flexibility services to maximize value—either using the same capacity for different services at different times (jumping), splitting capacity between services at the same time, or using the same capacity for multiple services simultaneously (co-delivery).

**Are there penalties for non-delivery?**
Yes, most services have performance requirements and penalties for under-delivery. Review contract terms carefully before committing.

**How do I get started?**
1. Use the Value Estimator to understand potential value
2. Check compatibility of relevant services for your asset type
3. Review technical requirements
4. Contact us or the relevant service operator (NESO/DNO) for next steps

### Glossary

**Energy Flexibility**
The ability to shift or shape when you use electricity—charging, discharging, or reducing load at specific times.

**Time-of-Use (TOU) Tariff**
Electricity pricing that varies by time of day—typically cheaper at night, more expensive at peak times (e.g., 4-7pm).

**Peak Shaving**
Reducing your maximum power demand during peak periods to lower demand charges and avoid grid stress.

**Demand Response**
Adjusting electricity use in response to grid signals or price changes—often rewarded with payments or lower bills.

**Ancillary Services**
Services that help keep the grid stable—frequency response, voltage control, reserve capacity. Provided to NESO.

**Baseline**
Your estimated "normal" electricity use without flexibility actions—used to measure how much you've shifted or reduced.

**Flexibility Window**
The time range when you're willing or able to shift your electricity use (e.g., EV charging between 10pm-6am).

**Virtual Power Plant (VPP)**
A network of distributed energy assets (batteries, EVs, generators) coordinated as a single flexible resource.

**Co-Delivery**
Using the same capacity (MW) for multiple services at the same time in the same direction. Example: Providing frequency response while in a capacity market contract.

**Splitting**
Dividing your asset's capacity between different services at the same time. Example: 5 MW battery split into 3 MW for one service, 2 MW for another.

**Jumping**
Switching the same asset between different services at different times. Example: Providing peak reduction during the day, frequency response at night.

**NESO (National Energy System Operator)**
The organization responsible for balancing electricity supply and demand across Great Britain's transmission system (formerly National Grid ESO).

**DNO (Distribution Network Operator)**
Regional companies managing local electricity networks (e.g., UK Power Networks, Northern Powergrid). They run local flexibility services.

**Capacity Market (CM)**
A long-term market where you're paid to guarantee capacity availability during peak demand periods.

**Dynamic Containment (DC)**
The fastest frequency response service—automatically corrects frequency deviations within 1 second using batteries or other fast assets.

**Demand Flexibility Service (DFS)**
National scheme for reducing electricity demand during peak periods (typically 4-7pm)—available to households and businesses.

## Estimator - Assumptions Expander

### Transparent Math

**How We Calculate Estimates**

**Cost Savings**:
Savings ≈ (kWh shifted) × (peak rate - off-peak rate) × participation rate × 365 days

**Potential Incentives** (if toggled):
Estimates assume eligibility for relevant programs. Actual availability varies by location, asset type, and contract terms. Shown as a range based on typical rates.

**CO₂ Estimate**:
CO₂ saved ≈ (kWh shifted from peak to off-peak) × (peak emission factor - off-peak emission factor)
Default emission factors: Peak = 0.25 kg/kWh, Off-peak = 0.15 kg/kWh (editable)

**All coefficients are editable**—adjust them to match your specific situation.
